#Live Annotation Tool
<sub>*(For the machine learning course at the University of WÃ¼rzburg)*</sub>

**This tool is still under development, please make copies of your annotation files before use!**

This tool should provide an easy way to create annotation files for gesture learning.

To synchronize the annotation times, you have to output the current timestamp in milliseconds at the start of recording.
The annotation tool also creates an file with the current timestamp.
After recording you can use the review annotation view to update the annotation times.
